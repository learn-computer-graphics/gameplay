# Gameplay mechanics from shipped games re-implementation

[![RSS Badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=RSS&message=Follow&color=success&logo=rss)](https://github.com/learn-computer-graphics/gameplay/commits.atom)

Try to redo great gameplay mechanics from awesome games in Unreal Engine. The process is similar to what [Mix and Jam](https://www.youtube.com/mixandjam) does with Unity.

As the size of these projects can be large, they are hosted on Gitlab under the [learn-computer-graphics](https://gitlab.com/learn-computer-graphics) group.

Our content is [viewable on our blog](https://learn-computer-graphics.com/gameplay/) with the help of Jupyter Book. You can also use the book as [standalone](https://gameplay.learn-computer-graphics.com/) for better performance on mobile.

## How to build

Need to install python. Then move inside the repository folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Finally, build the book by running `jupyter-book build .`
